Section that explains commands and gives example(s) usage for use Vi to create and edit files on Linux and the basic commands that you need to manage the file system.

- **Cd:** is the command line to change the current working directory. It is also known as the chdir. Within a file system there could potentially be more than one directory. In order to be able to move around the command cd would be needed. It would be cd [directory-name].

	- _Example:_ Working in directory 456 and needing to move to directory 654 the following would need to be entered as the command: cd 654

- **Mkdir:** is used to make a new directory. Making a new directory is similar to having folders to help better organize the model. In order to create a new directory the following command would be entered : mkdir [dir-name]

 	- _Example:_  In order to make a new directory names New, the following command would be entered mkdir New 1

- **CP:** is used to copy files or directory into another file. The command would need to be entered as follows: cp [Src_file] [Dest_file]

	- _Example:_ To copy file abc.txt into file xyz.txt the following would need to be entered: cp abc.txt xyz.txt
	
- **PWD:** command stands for the present working directory. It will show you once pwd is entered which directory you are currently working in. 
	- _Example:_ Enter pwd on the command line. After you will get the directory you ae currently working in. 

- **MV:** moves files or directories from one location to another. The command would be listed as follows: mv [OPTIONS] source destination
	- _Example:_ In order to move file 456.txt to directory /test the following command would be entered: mv 456.txt /test

- **RM:** removes the files or directories. It would be used to delete those files or directories indicated. This would be done once they are no longer needed. To removed the following command would need to be entered: rm filename
	- _Example:_ In removing file wrong.txt, the following would be entered rm wrong.txt

- **History:**  is the base for the directory. The default is usually the users name.  To move back to the home directory cd~ would be used
	- _Example:_  In the command line, history would be typed in. A print listing of all action taken within the session should populate. 

- **Home Directory:** is the base for the directory. The default is usually the users name.  To move back to the home directory cd~ would be used. 
	- _Example:_ If the home path were /home/Susan then to get back home from another directory in the command line enter cd~ to be returned home.  

- **File Paths:** in Linux are a human-readable representation of a file or folderâ€™s location on a computer system.
	- _Example:_ File path - /home/Susan/work/test/
	
- **Using the tab key to complete file paths :** will allow you to speed up typing commands, and file paths. 
	- _Example:_ If we have a long  complex file name beginning with the letter L we would just have to type L and press tab to automatically complete it, however if we have multiple files that begin with L we would just have to type a little bit more of the file.

- **Using up and down arrow for history:** is used to scroll/browse through your recent command history.
	- _Example:_ To review history scroll using the up and down arrow
