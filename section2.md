Workflow and have a section to define and give examples of how to use the following Git commands and terminology:



*Repository:It is a git/file location where all the files are stored.

*Clone (git clone ):It is a command line utility that is used to target an existing repository and create a clone or copy of the target repository.


 *Example: Make a clone of a repository in a new directory at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine.
