1. Forking vs Cloning
* They are similar, they are related, they are not interchangeable. *
- Forking
  - A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. A forked repository differs from a clone in that a connection exists between your fork and the original repository itself. In this way, your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy where you can contribute back to the original project using Pull Requests.

  - ** Example: ** Forking a project is as easy as clicking the Fork button in the header of a repository. Once the process is complete, you'll be taken right to your the forked copy of the project so you can start collaborating!
