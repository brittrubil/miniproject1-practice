Using the tab key to complete file paths - tab key completion will allow you to speed up typing commands, and file paths. For example: If we have a long  complex file name beginning with the letter L we would just have to type L and press tab to automatically complete it, however if we have multiple files that begin with L we would just have to type a little bit more of the file lil.
